# presdentz
coding playabout
The code is not optimized in any way, nor is it fully tested,  i just wanted to see if I could remember how to build pipelines from scratch. You can run it like this  
$codingchallenge.bash filenamewithpresidentsin  
or it can read a file in the current directory called presidents.csv. It should be run within the bash shell. Yes  could but #!/usr/bin/bash on line 1 but that would make the code waaaaay tooo looong at 2 lines :)
