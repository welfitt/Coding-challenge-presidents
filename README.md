# presdentz
coding playabout
The code is not optimized in any way, nor is it fully tested,  i just wanted to see if I could remember how to build pipelines from scratch. You can run it like this  
$codingchallenge.bash filenamewithpresidentsin  
or it can read a file in the current directory called presidents.csv. It should be run within the bash shell. Yes  could but #!/usr/bin/bash on line 1 but that would make the code waaaaay tooo looong at 2 lines :)


Problem:
@here This weekâ€™s problem is simple - in which year were the most US presidents alive? Your task is to programatically answer this question, given the set of CSV data. These presidents may either have been future presidents, actively serving presidents, or previous presidents.
